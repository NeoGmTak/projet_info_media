                                    <p>Saint-Jean Cathedral is one of the highlights of the medieval and Renaissance district of Vieux Lyon. Completed in 1480, after three centuries of construction.
                                        Saint-Jean Cathedral was heavily damaged during the religious guesswork in 1562 and by the French Revolution in 1793.
                                        It was restored in the 19th century, first in classicism and then after the arrival of a new architect in the Gothic style. The Second World War interrupted the work, particularly in 1944, during the withdrawal of German troops, when the district suffered sabotage and explosions broke the stained glass windows.
                                        Once the war was over. Work resumed and ended at the beginning of the 21st century.
                                        It has been classified as a "Historic Monument" since 1862, then in 1964 it was integrated into the first "Saved Sector".
                                        Finally, in December 1998, it was recognized as a World Heritage Site for its location in the historic site of Lyon.</p>

                                    <p>The church of St. George was built in the 6th century. In 1315, the Knights of the Order of Saint Jean de Jerusalem settled in the monastery of the church. In 1492, the church was restored.
                                        But in 1796 the bell tower collapsed. Declared "National Property" it was sold in 1807, but a fire destroyed it in 1854.
                                        It was rebuilt from 1842 onwards.</p>

                                    <h2 class="heading">Temple du Change</h2>
                                    <p>Built between 1631 and 1653, the Temple du Change is a old trading house.
                                        Originally a small, classic building, the space he proposed was insufficient but no changes could be made until 1748.
                                        The semi-detached houses were demolished, which allowed the building to be enlarged, giving rise to a fifth arcade on the facade and, above all, a large room at the rear, which is as high and as wide as the building.
                                        During the Revolution, the Temple of Change was abandoned and temporarily became an inn.
                                        In 1803, it was attributed to the protestants and underwent major interior alterations.
                                        In 1913 its facade is classified as a "Historic Monument" and the rest of the building was listed as a "Historic Monument" in 2013.
                                        Finally, in 2015, the city of Lyon is undertaking major restoration work on the entire building.</p>

                                This museum houses two permanent collections, one dedicated to the art of miniature and the other to the techniques of special effects of cinema, twelve of which are dedicated to it, including materials and pieces of origin: masks and prostheses, animatronics, vehicles and miniature decorts but also life-size.
                                The museum also occasionally hosts temporary exhibitions.</p>

                                Founded by Mr. Charnoud, it was the Cardelli family who took over the direction in 2003 in order to continue to perpetuate the shows and the talk of Lyon.
                                Since then, the theatre has continued to produce shows adapted to everyone, concerts and café theatre.</p>

                                <p>The city of Lyon has about 500 traboules, 215 of which are leaking in the Vieux Lyon. They date from the Renaissance and were built according to the roman patio model with its galleries and the well in the courtyard.
                                    The traboules were mainly used to access the borders of Saône and to reach from one street to another quickly.
                                    Today, most traboules are private but some of them remain open to the public and are maintained at 70% by the city of Lyon.</p>
